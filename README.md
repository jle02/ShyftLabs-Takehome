# ShytLabs-Takehome

generated swagger models and http function stubs through go swagger
https://goswagger.io/install.html

command to generate swagger models is:

    swagger generate server -t gen -A Shyftlabs.io --exclude-main -f ./swagger.yml 

this allowed me to start with a swagger definition that can be easily agreed upon by the backend and frontend devs who're working on the feature and then work on writing out the business logic in the handler functions with the db models. The swagger models are autogenerated so we can use them out of the box.

Used postgres db for local testing
    DB credentials in production should never be stored in code, usually it'd be retrieved by from a secret deployed in in whichever cloud provider is being used at the time

entry point is main.go and business level handler logic is in handlers.go/courseHandler.go/studentHandler.go/resultHandler.go

to run the program I used: 

    go run cmd/shyftlabs-io-server/main.go

Some enhancements that can be made: 
    move out handler logic into managers if the logic gets a bit more complicated. Handlers should just be handling the http request and respoonse logic as well as transforming the db model to the swagger model for the response. A manager should be the one to have access to the repositories.
